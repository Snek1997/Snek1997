## 🚀 About Me

I’m a detail-driven QA Engineer with a passion for quality, efficiency, and clean automation. I earned my QA Engineering Certification through [TripleTen](https://tripleten.com/), where I worked on real-world projects using **Python**, **Selenium**, and **PyTest**.

Currently working at **FedEx Ground** as a Package Handler, I’ve learned to value precision, speed, and process—all of which transfer perfectly into my approach to testing software systems.

Outside of work? I’m a lifelong gamer 🎮, movie nerd 🎬, and LEGO collector 🧱—which basically means I love spotting patterns, solving puzzles, and building things from the ground up.
